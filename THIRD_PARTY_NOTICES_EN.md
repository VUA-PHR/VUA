# Third-party notices

VUA includes or depends on third-party software. Those components remain subject to their own
licenses; the repository's Apache-2.0 license does not replace them.

## Current source dependencies

The current Rust workspace directly declares the following third-party crates:

| Dependency | Declared license family | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vrc-get-vpm` | MIT | VRChat package and project operations |
| `tokio` | MIT | asynchronous runtime |
| `reqwest` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | HTTP client |
| `rusqlite` | MIT | Orchestrator authoritative-task SQLite adapter |
| `serde`, `serde_json` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | serialization |
| `sha2` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | content hashing |
| `windows-sys` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | Windows Job Object process-tree supervision |
| `jsonschema` | MIT | schema validation in tests |

`rusqlite` enables its `bundled` feature and statically builds SQLite, which is in the public domain.
The Orchestrator persistence adapter owns this dependency. It may be removed only by a replacement
that passes the same database-format, transaction, durability, and recovery characterization tests.

The Unity Bridge package declares VRChat Avatars SDK and Modular Avatar as Unity package
dependencies. They are resolved from their own package sources and are not relicensed by VUA.

This is a human-readable summary, not a complete generated bill of materials. `Cargo.lock`, Unity
package manifests, and future JavaScript lockfiles are the authoritative dependency snapshots.
Transitive dependencies currently include multiple permissive licenses and components under
licenses such as MPL-2.0, Unicode-3.0, Zlib, and CDLA-Permissive-2.0.

## Distribution rule

Before a binary release, the project must generate and review a complete dependency and license
inventory for that exact build, preserve all required license and attribution texts, and separately
approve every bundled third-party binary. Support for connecting to externally installed software
does not imply permission to redistribute it.

If this summary conflicts with a dependency's license text, the dependency's license text controls.
