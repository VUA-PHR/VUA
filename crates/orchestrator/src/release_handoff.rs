//! The `release.openForHandoff` core use-case face (proposal 023 freeze
//! batch follow-up slice 2: task orchestration facts + completion-judgment
//! types + editor-identity resolution wiring). The contract face (word
//! list row, params closed set, fact shape, error-code closed set) was
//! frozen in the 2026-09-16 core freeze batch; this module lands the CORE
//! side of the implementation domain:
//!
//! 1. **The process/window domain port** (`ReleaseHandoffPort`): the
//!    production-domain contract (023 production stance: the Bridge command
//!    face presumes an already-open project, so the handoff is editor-process
//!    lifecycle management — unity-bridge v3 gains zero operations). The
//!    port owns both paths (launch via `Unity.exe -projectPath` when the
//!    project is closed, OS focus when open) AND the handshake wait — the
//!    completion judgment lives behind this port and is NEVER "process
//!    started" (core freeze ruling 3: completion = Bridge handshake
//!    arrival, 001 chain; OS focus enters neither the judgment nor the
//!    fact). The concrete adapter lands with the production-domain slice;
//!    this trait IS the frozen cross-domain contract for it.
//! 2. **Editor-identity resolution** (`resolve_handoff_editor`, core
//!    freeze ruling 5): explicit injection (021 authority) > the build
//!    record's carried editor version matched against observed candidates >
//!    typed unresolved (the route answers `vua.release_handoff.
//!    editor_unresolved`; diagnosis reuses the environment.verifyEditor
//!    semantics — no new vocabulary).
//! 3. **The handoff fact document** (`build_handoff_fact`): the frozen
//!    five-key closed set (schemaVersion/buildId/projectId/editor
//!    {exePath,version}/occurredAt) — no upload-status field exists by
//!    construction (honesty rules 1/2 pinned by shape; the negative vector
//!    pins it).
//!
//! Honest-absence note: when the port is NOT wired into the provider host,
//! the route answers `vua.release_handoff.unavailable` — the frozen
//! honest-absence semantics stay the default until the production-domain
//! adapter slice lands.
//!
//! v0.2 delta (U19 user ruling, 2026-09-21, BOARD row as normative source):
//! the family gains the record-state admission gate and the independent
//! inspection entry. (1) The handoff admission validates the build record's
//! `status` against the ruling whitelist BEFORE any task is accepted:
//! `succeeded` / `succeeded_with_warnings` pass (the warning presentation
//! stays a desktop concern — the record is never rewritten);
//! `failed` / `cancelled` / `rolled_back` / `recovered` are refused as
//! `vua.release_handoff.record_state_blocked` (typed rejection carrying the
//! record's original state value as the `state` param); a missing,
//! non-string, or out-of-enum status is refused as
//! `vua.release_handoff.record_state_unknown` (the record cannot be
//! confirmed). The whitelist is a product-policy choice (ruling correction
//! a), not a fact check — the state is the fact, "which states may hand
//! off" is the policy. (2) `release.openForInspection` is the explicit
//! "open in Unity to inspect/fix" path (ruling: opening the editor is
//! neither recovery-execution nor upload permission): its admission is the
//! handoff admission MINUS the state gate (record existence + project
//! identity + editor resolution only), and its completion fact carries an
//! explicit `operation` key so no consumer can misread it as a handoff
//! fact — the wording never claims a completed handoff. The ruling's three
//! corrections are pinned by shape/tests: recovered ≠ the task-face
//! inspect_required (the two state sets are never mixed; a completed
//! inspection never rewrites a failed history record to success), and a
//! succeeded record does not guarantee the project still matches it (this
//! gate prevents obviously wrong handoffs; it never claims to remove the
//! whole "upload the wrong avatar" risk).
