//! The recipe-export v0.1 core port face (proposal 029 B-face wiring loop 2,
//! core batch 2026-09-22) and the REAL export executor (implementation loop
//! 3, same day). The frozen word-row `recipe.exportProjectDraft`
//! (`schemas/recipe-export/v0.1/`, freeze batch the same day) routes through
//! the [`ProjectDraftExportPort`] trait — the synchronous read-only Query
//! that derives a RECIPE DRAFT (never a Recipe) from one registered Unity
//! project. This module lands the port face, the typed draft document, and
//! (loop 3) the on-disk executor [`OnDiskProjectDraftExporter`] over the
//! standing proposal-013 inspection facts: VPM manifest declared
//! dependencies + locked pins, the observed editor version, the VUA-native
//! identity tri-state.
//!
//! Structure (three rulings of the freeze batch, 029 inline core section):
//!
//! 1. **Synchronous Query, no tasked face** (ruling 3): the scan touches
//!    local project files only — no Bridge, no network, nothing to cancel,
//!    nothing to recover. The port method returns the document directly;
//!    no nine-state task is minted (the packages-ops preview/query
//!    precedent).
//! 2. **Declared-none capability default** (the 025 `catalog_capabilities`
//!    accessor law, ORC-DEV-004: no implementation, no reservation): the
//!    defaulted `export_capabilities` accessor answers declared-none, so a
//!    wired-but-unimplemented port keeps the served capability row and the
//!    route honestly unavailable (`vua.recipe_export.unavailable`) until
//!    the implementing adapter overrides the accessor (the environment
//!    implementation-verification slice flips it — the F5
//!    `template_capabilities` law verbatim).
//! 3. **The draft is its own type** (ruling 2): [`ProjectDraftDocumentV01`]
//!    carries NO recipeId, NO title, NO assets/instances/relations/
//!    wardrobeGroups and NO locked block — `deny_unknown_fields` makes a
//!    draft claiming the Recipe face unrepresentable at the type level, and
//!    the family const is stamped by the wire route at envelope assembly
//!    (the P1 discipline: the route stamps the consts, the port facts stay
//!    verbatim), so the typed document carries exactly the six fact keys.
//!
//! The port's typed refusals travel verbatim through the wire route (the
//! read-face pass-through discipline — no read-face fold exists). The
//! reused registration refusal `vua.project.project_not_found` (024
//! packages-query ruling: same fact, same code) is answered by the ROUTE's
//! registration calibration over the same 013 aggregate
//! `project.inspectProject` uses — an off-aggregate path never reaches the
//! port. Zero new error codes: the face's closed set is
//! `vua.recipe_export.unavailable` / `vua.recipe_export.invalid_params` /
//! the reused `vua.project.project_not_found`.
