//! The VUA-native project identity file (user rulings 2026-09-09, items
//! 7 and 12): a migrated/imported project carries `.vua/project.json` as
//! the folder's VUA-unique marker, and that same file holds the user note
//! (displayed only in the project list).
//!
//! Three artifacts already live in a project's `.vua/` directory; this is
//! the identity/metadata one:
//!
//! - `project.lock` — runtime exclusion gate ([`crate::project_lock`]);
//! - `pending-mutation.json` — crash-evidence marker ([`crate::project_lock`]);
//! - `source.json` — import-copy source link (proposal 014);
//! - `project.json` — **this file**: the VUA-native declaration plus the
//!   user note.
//!
//! Semantics the detection face reports:
//!
//! - absent — no identity file: not a VUA-native project (its `.vua/` may
//!   still exist holding only lock artifacts, which is why "has `.vua/`"
//!   alone is not the native marker);
//! - present — a parseable identity at the current version;
//! - unreadable — the file exists but cannot be parsed (or carries an
//!   unknown version): itself evidence, never silently reported as clean.
//!
//! Note scope (ruling 12): the note is stored here and shown only in the
//! project list; setting one on a project without an identity file is
//! refused — the note feature presupposes the VUA-native declaration.
